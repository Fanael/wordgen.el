(cl-defun wordgen (ruleset &key (word-count 1) (starting-rule nil) (seed nil))
  "Generate random words using rules described in RULESET.

The result is a list of WORD-COUNT random words.
Each word is the result of evaluation of STARTING-RULE.
The default STARTING-RULE is `result'.

SEED is a sequence of integers (a string, a list of integers, etc.) used to
initialize the pseudo-random number generator. When nil, a default seed is
obtained from /dev/urandom or, if that fails, from the current time.

RULESET is a list of lists of the form (RULE-NAME EXPRESSION), where RULE-NAME
is a symbol.
Rules always evaluate to a string.

EXPRESSION can be one of the following:
 * A symbol RULE-NAME, which evaluates the rule named RULE-NAME and returns its
   result.

 * An integer, which evaluates to itself.

 * A string, which evaluates to itself.

 * A vector [CHOICE-ELEMENT ...], which randomly chooses one of its elements and
   evaluates it.

   CHOICE-ELEMENT can be either a list (WEIGHT EXPRESSION), or just an
   EXPRESSION. In the latter case, the WEIGHT is assumed to be 1.
   WEIGHT is an integer used to control the probability of picking an element:
   P(element) = P(weight) / P(sum of all weights).

 * A list (++ EXPR-1 EXPR-2 ... EXPR-N), which evaluates all its arguments from
   left to right and concatenates the results.

 * A list (replicate TIMES EXPR), which evaluates expressions TIMES and EXPR,
   then returns a string of EXPR repeated TIMES times. For example:
   \(replicate 3 \"foo\") evaluates to \"foofoofoo\".

 * A list (concat-reeval TIMES EXPR), which evaluates the expression
   TIMES, then evaluates EXPR TIMES times, concatenating the results. For
   example:
   \(concat-reeval 2 [\"a\" \"b\"]) may evaluate to \"aa\", \"ab\", \"ba\"
   or \"bb\".

 * A list (lisp FUNC), where FUNC is an expression evaluating to a Lisp
   function. The function is called with two arguments (RULES RNG), where RULES
   is the compiled RULESET as returned by `wordgen-compile-ruleset' and RNG is
   an instance of the pseudo-random number generator that can be passed to
   `wordgen-prng-next-int'.
   It's likely a bad idea to pass a `lambda' as FUNC, because FUNC is copied
   straight into generated Emacs Lisp code, so the `lambda' will be compiled
   during RULESET compilation using `wordgen's internal settings. In particular,
   this means `lexical-binding' set to t.
   To be safe, store the `lambda' in a variable first and pass the variable name
   here.
   To return a string back to `wordgen' code, use `wordgen-print-string' instead
   of returning the string directly.
   To get a string from `wordgen-call-rule-by-name', use
   `wordgen-with-output-to-string'.

Any other EXPRESSION is unrecognized and results in an error being signaled at
RULESET compilation time.

Type errors, like (replicate \"foo\" 3) or (++ \"foo\" 10), also result in an
error being signaled during RULESET compilation."
